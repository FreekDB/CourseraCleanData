# CourseraCleanData

# Introduction

This project has been created as an assignment for the Coursera [Getting and Cleaning data course](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata), which is part of the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience). From the assignment description:

"The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. You will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected."
