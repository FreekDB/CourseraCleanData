# Notes

Tuesday August 18th 2015

Downloaded the [UCI HAR Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and read the README.txt file. What is the 561-feature vector?

Read the features_info.txt file. What is a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter? What is the Euclidean norm? What are autoregression coefficients with Burg order equal to 4? What are skewness and kurtosis of the frequency domain signal?

Read the features.txt and the activity_labels.txt files. (Maybe "LYING" instead of "LAYING" would have been better; see [OxfordWords blog: Lie or lay?](http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/03/lie-or-lay/).)

Looked at the first line of data in the train/X_train.txt file: 561 numbers.
